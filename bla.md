Hi Anicca Labs team,

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this exciting assignment.

I started working on the task right away and completed most of the core features, including authentication, global and personalized feeds, and post creation. However, I was unable to submit the final output within the deadline because the Expo EAS build queue was extremely delayed due to the free-tier limitations. The Expo EAS build queue was taking a very long time — sometimes up to 30, 40, even 80 minutes — which significantly slowed down my testing and delivery workflow. As a result, I couldn’t finish the task on time since a large portion of my time was spent waiting instead of iterating quickly. I’m still submitting the GitHub repository with all the progress I’ve made so far.

I hope you’ll consider the work I’ve done until this point. I’d still love the opportunity to be part of the team and contribute further if selected.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,  
Masum Abduss Sobhan
